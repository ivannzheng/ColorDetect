## Description 
This programs utilizes OpenCV in order to detect color in real time through your program. Press 'Q' will terminate the program when the webcam is up and running.

## Challenges 
Had a issue with the program not detecting red well, so the solution I came up with was to add its own hue range. This made it so any shade of red could be detected, as the red needed a larger range compared to the other colors 

## Feature

If multiple items of the same color are shown or spread apart it will only outline the largest one
