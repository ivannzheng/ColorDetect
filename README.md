# colordetect
This programs utilizes OpenCV in order to detect color in real time through your program. Next steps would be to add a user interface rather than just a terminal program. This will most likely be done with FLask, along with HTML and CSS. To run this program now you will need to run the main.py file, and the prompt to the user asking what color will pop up. Enjoy!

Future plans - Use flask to make this raw python program into an actaual web app.
